        <h2>RULES</h2>

        <p>Each turn the player rolls two dice. If the player gets 1 on any of the dice he earns nothing and another
            player gets
            his turn. On getting 2-6 on the dice, player's sum is being added to his round score, until he decides
            to hold his
            current score. If the player holds his score, the other player gets his turn.</p>
        <br>

        <p>If a player gets 1s on any dice, the player loses all the points from his current and overall scores.
            The player who got 100 (or more) points wins the game.</p>
